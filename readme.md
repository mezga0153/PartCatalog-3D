# PartCatalog 3D 📦🔧

🌐 **[Live Demo](https://mezga0153.github.io/PartCatalog-3D/)** - Try it now!

A Three.js-powered 3D model analyzer that transforms your GLB files into a comprehensive parts catalog. Perfect for makers, engineers, and builders who need to understand what components are required to build the actual object their 3D model represents! 🎯

## What Does This Thing Do? 🤔

Ever looked at a 3D model and wondered "What parts do I actually need to build this?" Wonder no more! PartCatalog 3D:

- 🔍 **Dissects your GLB models** into individual components with precise specifications
- 📏 **Calculates exact dimensions** for each part (because every millimeter counts!)
- 📊 **Counts vertex data** to understand model complexity
- 🎨 **Identifies materials** for each component
- 💥 **Explodes/implodes models** for better visualization of assembly
- 🖱️ **Interactive part selection** with detailed popup specifications
- 👁️ **Hide/show components** to focus on specific parts
- ✅ **Mark parts to keep** for your build list
- 📊 **Export to Excel** - Generate a complete parts list with dimensions
- 📁 **Drag & drop file loading** - No more manual file editing!
- 🎯 **Smart bounding boxes** - Visual feedback for part identification
- 🎪 **Smooth animations** - Professional TWEEN.js powered transitions

## Perfect For 🎯

- **Makers & DIY Enthusiasts** - Planning your next build project
- **Engineers** - Analyzing component specifications
- **3D Printing** - Understanding part dimensions and complexity
- **Manufacturing** - Creating bills of materials from 3D models
- **Education** - Teaching 3D modeling and engineering concepts
- **Prototyping** - Breaking down complex assemblies
